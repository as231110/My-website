<h1 id="Beggining-title">MYSTERIES OF THE WORLD</h1>
  <p>
 Lost woman in space-<br>
So, you think exploring 5% of something is creepy? Well, we only explored 0.00000(and another<br>
huge amount of zeros that you wouldn’t be able to count if you lived for as long as the<br>
    universe)0000000001% of space.<br>
    </p>
<p>Settle down for a spine-chilling story.<br>
Two Italian brother once set up radios that could reach signals in outer space. Many years<br>
  passed, not hearing anything interesting…. Until November 1963. They received a signal from<br>
  space. After decoding it, they realized it was the voice of a woman. She was in pain, and<br>
  re-entering Earth. Many believe the cooling system of her capsule had failed, setting a<br>
  fire. Some believe that she was the first woman to ever enter space.
</p>

  <p>Mystery Bay-<br>
One of the creepiest historical mysteries to have ever occurred is in the mystery bay. This<br>
    mystery occurred all the way back in 1880… but that doesn’t make it any less dull. Warning- <br>
    this story is not for the faint hearted.
</p>
  
  <p>
1880, Lamont Young and 4 other men were spotted sailing on a boat towards the North. Lamont had been<br>
    sent to survey Bermagui, but had decided to go further North to survey some of the other potential<br>
    gold fields. A farmer, riding across what is now Mystery Bay, saw a ship crashed onto the Beach<br>
    among rocks- it’s sails missing. The ship was searched, and what was found will stun you. 5 bags<br>
    of clothes, Lamont’s spectacles, and neatly written notes- but despite neither of these tings<br>
    being out of place, there were definitely signs that something strange had happened.
</p>
  <p>
There was evidence someone had been extremely ill, despite the weather conditions that day not being<br>
    nearly extreme enough to make any of the men aboard seasick. There were also rocks in the hull of<br>
    the boat, apparently taken from the beach that the boat had been found in.
  </p>
A bullet was found embedded into the starboard side of the ship, and matching casing was found on the<br>
  beach. However, the creepiest and strangest of all is that there was a hole in the ship where it had<br>
  crashed into the rocks… but it had been made from the inside. There was also evidence that someone<br>
  had come ashore and made a meal on the ship- before vanishing.
  </p>
<p>
  There were no tracks of footsteps anywhere near the boat, and it had been assumed that the men were<br>
  lost at sea. Reports claim that miners were spotted walking to Sydney, but appeared to be very<br>
  out-of-place, and it is said that these might have been the murderers. But, of course… the rest<br>
  remains a mystery.
  </p>
<p>
  Colossal Squid.<br>
And now, a mystery from a place many will have expected… the Ocean. On our own planet, and yet we<br>
  have discovered only 5% of it.
  </p>
  <p>
This for those mythical creature-lovers and sea monster believers out there… Remains of a colossal<br>
    squid have been found in places. These creatures are thought to mainly dwell near the Antarctic<br>
    Ocean, and are over 30 feet in length. They also have tentacles armed with 3 deadly hooks.
  </p>

Ekaterinburg fireball-<br>
November 14th, 2014. It was nighttime in Ekaterinburg, when suddenly a huge Orange explosion took<br>
    place in the sky, resulting in a fireball that hung in the air for over 10 seconds. No sound<br>
    came out of it, unlike an explosion of that size. Some think that it could’ve been a meteor or<br>
    meteorite, however they release a quick bright white flash when they explode. An observatory also<br>
    confirmed that nothing had fallen in space that day. Other think it could’ve been a space mission,<br>
    however there latest one was the month before the explosion took place.
  </p>
Personally, I have a theory- I think it could’ve been the result of something huge exploding in very far<br>
  out space, and the because of how far it was, the sound will arrive in a few years.

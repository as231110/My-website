  <h2 class=heading> <em><strong>Intro</strong></em></h2>
    
    <p>
      Mysteries. Something many people have many opinions about, and treat differently. Some make mysteries their life, while others regard it a distraction.<br>
      Mysteries are everywhere. Why can't we remember our whole life? Why are hotdogs called hotdogs? Why are black and white considered <em>simple</em> and <em>basic</em><br>
      colours even though they are just a colour, like any other? Why is blue a <em>boy colour</em> and pink for girls? Some things will never be known. Mysteries.<br>
      Here I will be talking about some of the greatest, most contreversial, most spine-chilling, most well-known mysteries in History. <strong>don't read this in the dark!</strong><br>

  <h2 class=quotes><em><strong> “You’d think solving mysteries would bring you closure, that closing the loop would comfort and quiet your mind. But it never does.<br>
    The truth always disappoints.”</em></strong></h2><br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  
    
  <h2 class=title> <em>Mystery Bay-</em></h2><br>
<p>
  One of the <em>creepiest</em> historical mysteries to have <em>ever</em> occurred is in the mystery bay. This<br>
    mystery occurred all the way back in 1880… <strong>but that doesn’t make it any less dull</strong>. <strong><em>Warning- <br>
  this story is not for the faint hearted.</strong></em>
</p>
  
  <p>
    1880, <em>Lamont Young</em> and 4 other men were spotted sailing on a boat towards the North. Lamont had been<br>
    sent to survey <em>Bermagui</em>, but had decided to go further North to survey some of the other potential<br>
    gold fields. A farmer, riding across what is now Mystery Bay, saw a ship crashed onto the Beach<br>
    among rocks- it’s sails missing. The ship was searched, and what was found will <strong>stun you</strong>. 5 bags<br>
    of clothes, Lamont’s spectacles, and neatly written notes- but despite neither of these things<br>
    being out of place, there were <strong>definitely</strong> signs that something <em>strange</em> had happened.
</p>
  <p>
    There was evidence someone had been <em>extremely</em> ill, despite the weather conditions that day <strong>not</strong> being<br>
    <em>nearly</em> extreme enough to make any of the men aboard seasick. There were also rocks in the <em>hull</em> of<br>
    the boat, apparently taken from the beach that the boat had been found in.
  </p>
  <p>
A bullet was found embedded into the starboard side of the ship, and matching casing was found on the<br>
    beach. However, the <em>creepiest</em> and <em>strangest</em> of all is that there was a hole in the ship where it had<br>
  crashed into the rocks… <strong>but it had been made from the inside</strong>. There was also evidence that someone<br>
    had come ashore and made a <em>meal</em> on the ship- before vanishing.
  </p>
<p>
  There were no tracks of footsteps <strong>anywhere</strong near the boat, and it had been assumed that the men were<br>
  lost at sea. Reports claim that miners were spotted walking to Sydney, but appeared to be very<br>
  out-of-place, and it is said that these might have been the murderers. But, of course…<br>
  <em>the rest  remains a mystery.</em>
  </p>

  <h2 class=title><em>Colossal Squid.</em></h2><br>
<p>
  And now, a mystery from a place many <strong>will</strong> have expected… <em>the Ocean</em>. On our own planet, and yet we<br>
  have discovered <em>only 5%</em> of it.
  </p>
   <img src="https://media2.giphy.com/media/hnO7HE86HcSiY/200.webp?cid=ecf05e47sftwzqjhsk1e6f9v1smankhqvz7iue7td8zgyrlw&rid=200.webp&ct=g" height="480">
  <p>
This for those mythical creature-lovers and sea monster believers out there… Remains of a <strong>colossal</strong><br>
    squid have been found in places. These creatures are thought to mainly dwell near the Antarctic<br>
    Ocean, and are over <strong>30 feet</strong> in length! They also have tentacles armed with 3 deadly hooks.
  </p>
   
  <h2 class=title><em>Lost woman in space-</em></h2><br>
 <p>
   So, you think exploring 5% of something is creepy? Well, we only explored <strong>0.00000</strong><em>(and another<br>
huge amount of zeros that you wouldn’t be able to count if you lived for as long as the<br>
   universe)</em><strong>0000000001% of space.</strong><br>
    </p>
<p>
  Settle down for a <em>spine-chilling</em> story.<br>
Two Italian brother once set up radios that could reach signals in outer space. Many years<br>
  passed, not hearing anything interesting…. Until November 1963. They received a signal from<br>
  space. After decoding it, they realized it was the voice of a woman. She was in pain, and<br>
  re-entering Earth. Many believe the cooling system of her capsule had failed, setting a<br>
  fire. Some believe that she was the first woman to <strong>ever</strong> enter space.
</p>
  
  <h2 class=heading><em>Ekaterinburg fireball-</em></h2><br>
<p>
  November 14th, 2014. It was nighttime in Ekaterinburg, when <strong>suddenly</strong> a huge Orange explosion took<br>
    place in the sky, resulting in a fireball that hung in the air for over 10 seconds. No sound<br>
    came out of it, unlike an explosion of that size. Some think that it could’ve been a meteor or<br>
    meteorite, however they release a quick bright white flash when they explode. An observatory also<br>
    confirmed that nothing had fallen in space that day. Other think it could’ve been a space mission,<br>
    however there latest one was the month before the explosion took place.
  </p>
  <p>
Personally, I have a theory- I think it could’ve been the result of something huge exploding in very far<br>
  out space, and the because of how far it was, the sound will arrive in a <strong>few years</strong>.
  </p>

<h2 class=quotes><em><strong>“Stars, too, were time travelers. How many of those ancient points of light were the last echoes of suns now dead? How many had been born but their light<br>
    not yet come this far? If all the suns but ours collapsed tonight, how many lifetimes would it take us to realize we were alone? I had always known the<br>
    sky was full of mysteries—but not until now had I realized how full of them the earth was.”</strong></em></h2>
